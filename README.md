This repository contains the public portions of DataJoint schemas for basic processing data 
from neuroscience experiments that are shared between several members of Andreas Tolias' lab.
These schemas are hosted in a public repository and used as examples for DataJoint documentation.

Each schema may contain additional classes that are not included in this public repository
but may show up in some ERDs (entity relationship diagrams).
